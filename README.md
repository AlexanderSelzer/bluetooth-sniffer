A Bluetooth logger
========

And maybe even more...

This is part of a little project, which will attempt to demonstrate security considerations
to using Bluetooth.

I didn't find any other node.js libraries that did the same, so I'm creating it myself.
This could possibly branch off as another project.

Working on hciconfig -> JS Obj parser.
